# Ore-Grade-Machine-Learning-Dashboard
This project builds a machine learning classification model for laterite ore blocks based on geochemical features (Ni, Fe, SiOâ‚‚, Mg). It includes model training, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and an interactive dashboard using Streamlit with 2D/3D spatial visualization, CSV download, and database integration.
